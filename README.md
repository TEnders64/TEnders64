## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Gametime Hero on an app where anyone can start or connect with a community revolving around almost any common interest, such as sports, table games, watch parties, etc.
  -  I'm also revamping my [personal website](www.toddenders.com) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced React topics, and soon I will get into React Native to tap into mobile.
  -  I'm also knee deep in Leetcode's Data Structures and Algorithms Crash Course.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Front End, Back End, or Full Stack applications. My strengths are Python, JS (React included), and Django.
